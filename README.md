# Python Web Scraping
A collection of small projects revolving around web scraping using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. 

I wanted to explore and build skills that involve 'dirty' data that hasn't necessarily been pre-processed for me, and web scraping seemed like a good starting point to do so. 

I have done a couple of small projects where I have picked websites and pages and tried to produce a good workable dataset at the end of it that could be used for further analysis, model building or visualisations. 

_As websites are developed and changed, these scripts might stop working as they are specific to the html structure at a given point in time, but they were working when I committed the changes!_
